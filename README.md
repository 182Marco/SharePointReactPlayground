# React SPFx Playground


Welcome to my personal **React SPFx (SharePoint Framework)** playground!  
This project is a dedicated space where I experiment with SPFx development using React, in preparation for upcoming professional projects at work.

This repository serves as a sandbox environment to:

- Explore and practice SPFx development with React
- Understand the SharePoint Framework architecture and tooling
- Build reusable components and web parts
- Prepare for real-world SharePoint projects in a professional setting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** (with hooks and functional components)
- **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** v1.x
